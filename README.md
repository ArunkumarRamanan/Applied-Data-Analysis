# Applied-Data-Analysis

## Personal Project to solve applied data mining tasks hosted at [www.kaggle.com]
## I will post a complete writeup of the approach I took for a particular competition, so that it helps me create
## a collection of IPython notebooks and scripts which would be useful later for me and others as well.
## I will spend 2-3 weeks on a problem to make sure I end up in top 1 percent on private leaderboard
